Without use of any date aware functions or classes write a method (pseudocode acceptable) called addDays that takes an integer number of days that will add the given number of days to the date. You can assume that the Gregorian calendar exists for all time and that there are no leap years.

The date class is defined as:

public class Date {
       public int year;
       public int month;
       public int dayOfMonth;

              
       public Date(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth) {
         this.year = year;
         this.month = month;
         this.dayOfMonth = dayOfMonth;
       }
     }
